## System Architecture Analysis

### Core Processing Framework

The live re-identification system operates on a dual-camera architecture:

- **Camera A (Reference):** Captures vehicles at entry/reference point
- **Camera B (Target):** Monitors parking area or secondary location  
- **Real-time Processing:** Multi-threaded feature extraction and comparison
- **RTSP Integration:** Network camera support with adaptive reconnection

### Feature Extraction Performance

Comprehensive testing revealed varying performance across different methods:

- **MobileNet (Recommended):** 72-75% accuracy, optimal speed-accuracy balance
- **ResNet:** Higher accuracy but computationally intensive
- **SIFT:** Good for distinct vehicle features, variable lighting conditions. *(Not a practical option, since it only detects exact frames.)*
- **Composite Method (MobileNet V2 + ResNet):** Best accuracy but highest computational cost
- **Histogram & HOG:** Fast processing but lower accuracy in complex scenarios

## Camera Installation and Positioning Guidelines

### Reference Camera (Camera A) Installation

**Optimal Positioning Strategy:**  
The reference camera should be strategically positioned at entry points where vehicles are most isolated and clearly visible.

#### Installation Requirements:

**Example 1: Entry Gate Positioning**

![Figure 1: Good Example for Entry Gate Position of Reference Camera](placeholder-for-figure-1)

*Figure 1: Good Example for Entry Gate Position of Reference Camera*

![Figure 2: Bad Example for Entry Position of Reference Camera](placeholder-for-figure-2)

*Figure 2: Bad Example for Entry Position of Reference Camera, May get wrong absurd features of the car!*

**Description:** Install the reference camera some meters from the entry gate at a height of 2.5-3 meters. Position it to capture vehicles as they pass through the entry point when they are isolated from other vehicles. This positioning ensures:

- Clear front/rear vehicle views without obstruction
- Minimal background clutter or other vehicles in frame
- Optimal lighting conditions during peak hours
- Single vehicle tracking without confusion from multiple objects

**Example 2: Isolated Entry Lane**

![Figure 3: Illustration of Good Isolated Camera on Entry](placeholder-for-figure-3)

![Figure 4: Acceptable Case (Not Perfect)](placeholder-for-figure-4)

*Figure 4: Acceptable Case (Not Perfect)*

![Figure 5: Bad Example](placeholder-for-figure-5)

*Figure 5: Bad Example, might give wrong and confused results because of multiple entries and less feature extraction possibilities.*

**Description:** Mount the reference camera to cover a dedicated entry lane where vehicles approach individually. The camera should capture a 15-20 meter stretch of road leading to the parking area. This setup provides:

- Extended tracking time for multiple angle capture
- Reduced environmental interference
- Clear separation between entering vehicles
- Consistent vehicle detection and feature extraction

### Target Camera (Camera B) Installation

**Strategic Parking Area Coverage:**  
The target camera must be positioned to maintain visual continuity with reference camera angles while covering the parking destination area.

#### Installation Requirements:

**Example 1: Parking Area Overview**

![Figure 6: Parking Area Overview](placeholder-for-figure-6)

*Figure 6: Parking Area Overview*

**Description:** Install the target camera at 3-4 meters height covering the main parking area. Position it to capture vehicles as they transition from entry to parking spots. This positioning ensures:

- Same vehicle angle coverage as reference camera (front, side, rear views)
- Continuous tracking from entry point to final parking position
- Multiple feature extraction opportunities during parking maneuver
- Clear visibility of final vehicle positioning

**Example 2: Approach Lane + Parking Zone**

![Figure 7: Approach Lane + Parking Zone](placeholder-for-figure-7)

*Figure 7: Approach Lane + Parking Zone*

**Description:** Mount the target camera to cover both the approach lane and parking spaces. The camera should capture a wider area that includes the transition zone where vehicles move from entry to parking. This setup provides:

- Extended observation time for feature collection
- Multiple angle captures during approach and parking
- Sufficient data for reliable re-identification
- Continuous vehicle tracking without blind spots

### Critical Installation Considerations

**Height and Angle Optimization:**
- **Optimal Height:** 2.5-3.5 meters above ground
- **Optimal Angle:** 15-30 degrees downward tilt
- **Coverage Distance:** 15-25 meters per camera
- **Resolution:** Minimum 1080p for reliable feature extraction

**Environmental Factors:**
- Avoid direct sunlight exposure during peak hours
- Ensure adequate artificial lighting for night operations
- Consider weather protection housing
- Maintain clear line of sight without obstructions

**Network Infrastructure:**
- Stable network connectivity for RTSP streams
- Minimum 10 Mbps bandwidth per camera
- Backup connectivity options recommended
- Local processing capability for reduced latency
